# Voting Web-app on the Rinkeby Network

Hi! This is my final year project. The objective of the project is to create a secure decentralised system for voting that will combat electoral fraud using the blockchain. I built a site that takes a number of candidate names' alongside their respective ethereum addresses and deploys them inside of a smart contract onto the rinkeby network. The deployed contract will be called back, where voters can then cast a vote to their desired candidate onto the ballot table.

## How to Install and Run the Project

```
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```


## Available Scripts


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Running Unit Tests

In the project the unit test have been written in the './tests/ballot.js' file in the Mocha framework.

To run, open terminal go to the project folder 'cd fyp_dapp' and type in `truffle test` and press `Enter`. 
The terminal will then run the unit test.

To get a deeper analysis of the test type in `truffle test --stacktrace-extra`. (This will turn on stack traces and will additionally compile contracts in Solidity's debug mode for additional revert messages)
